/**
 * RFB Server - Remote Frame Buffer (VNC Server) implementation. This is the base module if you want to create a VNC server. It takes a layered driver approach to add native specific features (which is recommened as the cross-platform default "Robot" driver is very slow).
 *
 * See the vncserver module for a concrete server implementation that has some native performance improvements for some platforms.
